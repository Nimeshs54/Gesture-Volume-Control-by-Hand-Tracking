# Gesture-Volume-Control-by-Hand-Tracking

In this project I have built an OpenCV application in which a user can control his system's (laptop/pc) volume by making Hand Gestures.

## Introduction :
This project is a use case of Hand Tracking technology.
As soon as the user shows up his hand in the camera the application detects it. We will use the hand landmarks to find the gesture of our hand to change the volume. 
Then according to the distance between user's Index finger and Thumb it displays the volume in the volume bar on the screen.
